Sky130 Day1 - Inception of open-source EDA, openLane and Sky130 PDK:

SKY130_D1_SK2 - SoC design and OpenLANE:

Digital ASIC Design:

Designing the digital application in an automated way requires several elemnets. The elements include hardware descriptive language, EDA tools and Process design kit (PDK) data

PDK: PDK is the collection of files used to model a fabrication process for the EDA tools. It is the interface between designers and fabrication team. PDK includes 
       i) Design rules such as DRC, LVS, PEX,
       ii) Device models,
       iii) Digital Standard cell Libraries,
       iv)  I/O libraries, etc.
